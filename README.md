# NEMO_CANAL

AIMS
-----

(1) - Initialise the NEMO CANAL with mean fields obtained from a high resolution atmosphere-ocean coupled model.

(2) - Calculate eddy energy and GEOMETRIC diagnostics 

FILES
------

mean_fields_for_initialisation.py - Interpolate the mean fields from the non-uniformly spaced coupled model grid to the uniformly spaced CANAL grid
